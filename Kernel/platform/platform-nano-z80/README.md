# nano-z80
The [nano-z80](https://github.com/venomix666/nano-z80) is a Z80 computer built around the inexpensive [Tang Nano 20K](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-nano-20k/nano-20k.html) FPGA board. It runs the T80 core at 25.125 MHz, has 8 MB of SDRAM, HDMI output and uses a micro-SD card for storage.

## Supported hardware
8 MB of pageable RAM in up to 128 64k banks (only 32 used currently)  
4 80x30 video terminals (on the HDMI output), switchable with F1-F4  
USB keyboard, interrupt driven    
2 serial ports with RX interrupts (one on the built-in USB-C connector, one TTL-level on the carrier board)  
Timer interrupt (100 Hz) + seconds from a psuedo RTC  
SD card storage using tinydisk with custom low level code   

## Install
See the [nano-z80 github page](https://github.com/venomix666/nano-z80) for details on how to setup both the FPGA board and SD-card.
