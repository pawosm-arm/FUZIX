# Status of 0.6 Work

## Move 6502 to Fuzix C Compiler

Done for all but pz1

## Move 6303/6803 to Fuzix C Compiler

Done

## Move 6809 to Fuzix C Compiler

Started but only a couple of conversions finished yet

## Move 68HC11 to Fuzix C Compiler

Not started

## Move 8080 and 8085 to Fuzix C Compiler

All targets completed. Userspace also moved. No relocatable binaries (as
before). Can build applications natively.

## Move Z80/Z180 To Fuzix C Compiler

Userspace entirely moved. Binaries relocatable as before. Need to move to
a better relocation solution for doing dynamic object modules.

Switched to the latest updates to the compiler and bintools kits. These put
everything in a sensibly laid out location.
